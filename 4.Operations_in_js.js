// ***********************************OPERATIONS IN JS*****************************

// we know basic mathematical operations and off course we are not going to study that here.

// We will be looking on some confusing examples...although they don't have any significant practical usage...still we will be studying those

//eg:

console.log("2" + 1); //o/p: 21
console.log(1 + "2"); // o/p: 12
console.log(1 + 2 + "2"); //o/p: 32
console.log("1" + 2 + 2); //o/p: 122

// these different answers are due to ECMA SCRIPT procedures and axioms and u have to learn these....

//some more

console.log(+true); // o/p: 1
// console.log(true+); // error statement...so it is comment out
console.log(+""); //o/p: 0
console.log();
