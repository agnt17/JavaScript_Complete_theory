//****************************----------------------> DOM SELECTORS <----------------------**************************//

//document.getElementById -----> it is used to fetch element by the id of that element 

//innerText: This method is used to get the text that is visible on the screen. 

//textContent: This method is used to get the text which is written on the HTML FILE it may be made visible to the Website  or may be not.

//innerHTML: This is used to give all the HTML that is written inside that tag.

//querySelector: querySelector is a JavaScript method that allows you to select a single element from the DOM (Document Object Model) using a CSS selector. 
//selector: A CSS selector string that specifies the criteria for selecting an element.

//Nodelist: Nodelist refers to the collection of nodes, typically returned by various methods like querySelectorAll or childNodes.Athough it is similar to array but it is also different from array as we cant access elements like array...to access elements in Nodelist we can do it using for each loop. It can also be converted into  a array using Array.from()

//HTMLCollection : The HTMLCollection interface represents a generic collection (array-like object similar to arguments) of elements (in document order) and offers methods and properties for selecting from the list.

//An HTMLCollection in the HTML DOM is live; it is automatically updated when the underlying document is changed. For this reason it is a good idea to make a copy (e.g., using Array.from) to iterate over if adding, moving, or removing nodes.
