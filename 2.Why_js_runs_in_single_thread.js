// JavaScript, as a single-threaded language, runs in a single execution thread. This means that at any given time, only one set of instructions is being executed. However, JavaScript utilizes an event-driven, non-blocking model that enables the illusion of concurrency without actually using multiple threads.

// Although we have a main thread and few  WEB WORKERS (responsible for parallel execution)...Basically what happens is that web workers allows to run the js code like doing mathematical calcs...other types of CPU PROCESSING...etc. They do not disturb the MAIN THREAD...and the UI, but creates themselves a memory space to execute the commands to run processess...Communication b/w MAIN THREAD and WEB WORKER is acheived through messaging b/w them.

// Thus...In summary, in JavaScript, a "thread" typically refers to a Web Worker, a background JavaScript execution context that runs concurrently with the main thread, allowing for parallel processing without blocking the user interface.
